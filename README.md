# Cardio-Vascular-Disease-Risk-Prediction-Aplication
This is an application aimed at predicting serious heart conditions based on various health parameters.

The CVD.csv file has been chosen from the Kaggle Dataset for the above problem statement.

Technology Used : Data Analysis and Machine Learning

Locally Hosted through : Streamlit

Exploratory Data Analysis : Preformed to gain a better understanding of the dataset and the type and nature of various features.

Data Visualisation : Done to find insights about relevant features and the relationships between them.

Data Preprocessing : Cleaning the dataset for relevant features and converting them to formats suitable for model training and testing.

Model Training and Testing : Building Machine Learning models through various classification algorithms and selecting the one with the most appropriate prediction score.

The LogisticRegression model is found to give a 91.88% accuracy for the given dataset.

The model is integrated into a web UI for actual predictions through streamlit.

The UI provides the user options to view both : the statistics used to build the model and also make predictions by providing necessary details.
