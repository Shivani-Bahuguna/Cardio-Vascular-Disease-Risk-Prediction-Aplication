# Cardio-Vascular-Disease-Risk-Prediction-Aplication
# This is an application aimed at predicting serious heart conditions based on a chosen dataset.
# The CVD.csv file has been chosen from the Kaggle Dataset for the above problem statement.
Technology Used : Data Analysis and Machine Learning
# Locally Hosted through : Streamlit
# Exploratory Data Analysis : Preformed to gain a better understanding of the dataset and the type and nature of various features.
# Data Visualisation : Done to find insights about relevant features and the relationships between them.
# Data Preprocessing : Cleaning the dataset for relevant features and converting them to formats suitable for model training and testing.
# Model Training and Testing : Building Machine Learning models through various classification algorithms and selecting the one with the most appropriate prediction score.

# The model is integrated into a web UI for actual predictions through app.py file.
# The UI provides the user options to view both : the statistics used to build the model and also make predictions by providing necessary details.
